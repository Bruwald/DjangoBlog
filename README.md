# DjangoBlog

To run this simple blog Django project:

1. Install django-crispy-forms using:

```pip install crispy django-crispy-forms```

2. Navigate to the myblog folder and run:

```python3 manage.py runserver```

3. Copy the link inside the browser

The project should have two users: user1 and user2 (with passwords 12341234a).

If there is a need to create a superuser please use the following command:

```python3 manage.py createsuperuser```

If for some unfortunate circumstance there isn't those two users when the project is run, 
please use the Sign-Up form as needed. Thank you!
